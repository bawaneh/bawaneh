This work investigates micromobility users (e-scooters, alternative transport) in immersive virtual reality environments, where ride-feedback mechanisms are used to encourage prosocial behaviour (e.g., courteous interaction, safe passing). The study evaluates behavioural outcomes, perceived risk, and user engagement, aiming to inform design of shared mobility interventions and XR-based training systems.
