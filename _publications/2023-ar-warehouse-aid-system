Order picking in inventory warehouses is one of the challenging tasks, especially for foreign workers due to language barriers found in current order picking instructions. To address this challenge, we took a user-centered design approach and developed an augmented reality (AR) aid system using a head-worn display (HWD). 

Unlike most AR warehouse aid systems that present icons or texts on fixed locations of the display, this system directly overlays visual symbols atop real-world objects to better guide workers' tasks. A pilot user study demonstrated that the proposed AR system improved user performance, perceived safety, and usability compared to traditional verbal instructions.

This work highlights the importance of designing AR solutions that bridge the gap between end-users and available technologies in warehouse environments.
