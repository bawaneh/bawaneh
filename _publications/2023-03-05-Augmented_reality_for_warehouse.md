**Backgound:**
In warehouse logistics, picking work comprises roughly 60% of the costs, emphasizing the need for efficiency (Matsumoto et al., 2019). Traditionally, workers utilize written instructions, which can be challenging for those less language proficient. The integration of augmented reality (AR) head- mounted displays (HMDs) may enhance accuracy and efficiency (Matsumoto et al., 2019). However, AR HMDs may come with some drawbacks—after extended use, some users report discomfort and decreased performance (Vidovič & Gajšek, 2020). Despite promising improvements in warehouse operations, HMDs’ long-term impacts remain uncertain (Fang et al., 2019). Furthermore, the influence of language proficiency on HMD effectiveness needs exploration (Murauer et al, 2018). In order to fully comprehend the potential and limitations of HMDs, further research is necessary, targeting effective strategies for implementation and optimal AR user interface (UI) design
