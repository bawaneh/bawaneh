**Abstract:**
The increasing popularity of automated vehicles and shared mobility services has led to the development of robotaxis as a new mode of transportation. To ensure a positive and safe user experience, effective human-machine interfaces (HMIs) are needed. This paper focuses on the design of external HMIs (eHMIs) for robotaxis, with a focus on using multiple modalities to enhance the user experience and improve communication between passengers and the automated system. By reviewing the current state of the art and key design considerations for eHMIs, this paper aims to contribute to the development of effective and user-friendly eHMIs for robotaxis with respect to rider-vehicle match process, passenger safety and security. The research team prototyped eHMIs in an immersive virtual environment using a virtual reality headset. The pilot study with five participants suggests a preference for the eHMI in robotaxi pickups, and its potential to enhance user experience and safety
