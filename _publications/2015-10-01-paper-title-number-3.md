This work presents the design and evaluation of an external human-machine interface (eHMI) intended for robotaxi vehicles, using immersive virtual reality/augmented reality methodologies. The interface aims to improve communication between autonomous vehicles (robotaxis) and external road users (pedestrians, other vehicles) by exploring effective messaging, signalling, and visibility. The study contributes to safer and more intuitive human-machine interactions in mobility systems.
