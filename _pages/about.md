I am **Ahmad Albawaneh**, a Ph.D. student in **Industrial Engineering and Operations Research** at the **University of Illinois Chicago [HCE Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/human-centered-engineering)**, advised by [**Dr. Hyungil (Hy) Kim**](https://mie.uic.edu/profiles/kim-hyungil/).  
My research lies at the intersection of **Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)** and **Extended Reality (XR)** - including **Virtual Reality (VR)**, and **Augmented Reality (AR)**- and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  with a focus on creating **adaptive**, **context-aware**, and **inclusive** interfaces that improve **human–machine cooperation**.

### 🔬 Research Focus

- **Adaptive & AI-Driven Interfaces:** Designing XR systems that adapt to users’ cognitive and emotional states in real time.  
- **Human–Robot Interaction (HRI):** Investigating how humans perceive and interact with intelligent agents, autonomous vehicles, and delivery robots.  
- **Extended Reality (XR):** Evaluating performance and usability in AR/VR environments to enhance situational awareness and safety.  
- **Inclusive Design:** Supporting non-native speakers and diverse populations in industrial and transportation contexts through accessible interface design.

### 🧩 Projects
- **Prosocial Feedback in Micromobility** – Exploring feedback mechanisms to promote courteous behavior among e-scooter riders in shared urban environments (in collaboration with *Honda Research Institute*). 
- **External HMI for Robotaxis** – Studying how communication between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians can be improved through visual and spatial cues in VR simulations.   
- **Augmented Reality Order Picking Aid** – Designing AR systems for multilingual warehouse workers to reduce cognitive load and improve task accuracy.  
- **User study**: Augmented Reality Order Picking Aid for Foreign Workers in Warehouses
