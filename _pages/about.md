I am **Ahmad Albawaneh**, a Ph.D. student in **Industrial Engineering and Operations Research** at the **University of Illinois Chicago [HCE Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/human-centered-engineering)**, advised by [**Dr. Hyungil (Hy) Kim**](https://mie.uic.edu/profiles/kim-hyungil/).  
My research lies at the intersection of **Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)** and **Extended Reality (XR)** - including **Virtual Reality (VR)**, and **Augmented Reality (AR)**- and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  with a focus on creating **adaptive**, **context-aware**, and **inclusive** interfaces that improve **human–machine cooperation**.

### 🔬 Research Focus

- **Adaptive & AI-Driven Interfaces.** XR systems that respond to users’ cognitive state and task context in real time.  
- **Human–Robot Interaction (HRI).** Communication and coordination with intelligent agents, autonomous vehicles, and delivery robots.  
- **XR Evaluation.** Performance, safety, immersion, and situational awareness in VR/AR tasks.  
- **Inclusive Design.** Interface strategies that support non-native speakers and novice users in industrial and transportation domains.

### 🧩 Projects

### Ongoing
- **Prosocial Feedback in Micromobility (Submitted).** Feedback designs to encourage courteous riding behavior among e-scooter users (with **Honda Research Institute**).  
- **External HMI for Robotaxis (Submitted).** VR-based evaluation of vehicle-mounted communication cues to support safer boarding.  
- **AR Order-Picking Aid (Submitted).** Multilingual, step-wise spatial guidance for warehouse workers.  
- **HYU Collaboration (Study in progress).** Joint project with **HYU** (details forthcoming).  
- **Review: XR and AI (Study in progress).** A structured synthesis of XR–AI methods for adaptive interaction and evaluation.
